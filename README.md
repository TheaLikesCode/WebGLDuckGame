This project was created for the computer graphics class at my university.
It's a prototype of a game, created in WebGL with three.js, where the goal is to jump on platforms (some of which move) with a duck avatar.
The duck was created by using accumulated matrix transformations and per-vertex collision detection.
I created the game itself whilst the other member of the group created the ocean shader.

This was created in 2014 and is therefore outdated and cannot be ran with newer versions of chrome, but I will work on updating it.
